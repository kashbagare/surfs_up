# surfs_up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use SQLite and SQLAlchemy along with Pandas dataframe in order to obtain temperature data from June and December in Oahu. We do this because we want to know if a surf and ice cream shop business would be able to run year-round. 

## Results 

### June Temperature Summary Statistics:

### December Temperature Summary Statistics:

- One key difference is that there are more temperatures on record in the month of June versus the month of December (1700 in June and 1517 in December)
- One key difference is that the average (or mean) temperature is hotter in the month of June versus the month of December (about 75 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December)
- One key difference is that the max temperature in June is hotter than the max temperature in December (85 degrees in June and 83 degrees in December)

## Summary 
When analyzing the differences in the summary statistics, it is clear that the differences are negligible in determining if a surf and ice cream shop business would be able to run year round. In terms of max temperature, both months have around the same max temp. In terms of min temperature, December has a little lower of a temperature compared to June but December is in the winter time (not to mention that min temperature was probably recorded at night). From the summary statistics, I believe that a surf and ice cream shop business would be able to run year round because temperature does not appear to be extremely volatile in Oahu.
